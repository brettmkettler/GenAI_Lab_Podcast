and I feel hurt and betrayed that chitty's changed his mind about premarital sex but despite how misguided chitty is by his faith I still love him I can't help it oh the irony the woman that believes in Aliens Illuminati and the universe purposefully blinding chitty for a reason now claims that his Christianity is misguided hilarious isn't it can't she see the peculiarity of her own beliefs she's says bizarre and weird things like my blindness is for a purpose which is outlandish and kind of insulting it seems like he lives in alternate reality yeah something tells me that Rene's peculiar way of viewing the world might be starting to grate on chitty but before we get to that let's rewind to the start so the last we saw the pair after the chicken incident chitty Finally Revealed his vow of self celibacy and it's safe to say Renee didn't take the news too well but as we join them in this episode as they're going on a walk where Renee is actually guiding chitty you can really feel the sense that he feels the need to try and make it up to her do you think these fishes can survive without the water no that will be my life without you without me you can literally see Rene's face sof often remember this is a woman who says she's lived without love and yes she's been in relationships and she has two kids but she's never felt this kind of love before she's told us so what she has with chitty is really special for her which is why chitty's revelation of celibacy hurt her so much she felt rejected that chitty didn't want her on a physical level and I feel hurt and betrayed that chitty's changed his mind about premarital sex but despite how misguided jitty is by his faith I still love him I can't help it she just can't resist can she she just had to have a little snipe at chitty's Faith like the thing is this doesn't come down to whether or not she believes in religion this is about respect she doesn't respect chitty she doesn't respect the beliefs he holds dearest to his heart like she's still convinced that she can get him to see the truth her truth that she'll be able to get him to turn his back on religion in favor of her so how exactly is she going to do that well the first step on that Quest is to try and clarify to chitty how she feels what we have what I'm looking for is so much deeper than just sex she tells him it just shocked me because all I wanted was the like love and cuddle on each other and actual just love and connection you know what I mean like I wasn't looking for just sex yes she says your stance on sex upsets me but don't get it twisted I didn't fly halfway across the world just to get laid she says I I want to get to know you on a deeper level she says and that means for me physical intimacy it means hugging you kissing you touching you and it means us just us spending oneon-one time together of course I would have wanted more but but I respect your decisions but I'll be waiting wow now Rene's understanding actually leaves chitty speechless he really wasn't expecting this from her now he does eventually go on to tell her that he appreciates how understanding she is I get it he says I get why you were so shocked after all I was the one that changed my mind about sex I can remember vividly how we talk so much about sex and our various charts and phone calls that's a pretty big admission isn't it it's chitty who's the one that moved the goalpost like he's the one that took part in clearly sexual phone calls video chats or whatever else but then at some point along the way decided he didn't want to actually have sex so that being the case asks Renee do you feel ashamed of how you acted that was who who I was at that time but we are all human beings and we are PR to change uh but you know I love you chitty tells Renee that he loves her and he's sexually attracted to her but he wants to hold off sex until the right time he says which to quote him in his own words isn't far off which I believe is not far off they may have only known each other in person for a few days but that sure does sound like a very strong hint that he's almost ready to marry Renee it's a lot isn't it it's very fullon and as I hear that it does make me wonder whether this might be a reoccurrence of the whole sex talk is Chitty the kind of guy that just says things that he thinks Renee wants to hear but then goes on to move the goalposts either way wherever the truth lies it's nice to see these two actually communicating their needs to one another I'm not a sex craze person I didn't come all the way over here just for that I came all the way over here to feel the love from chitty specifically so Renee may not be sex crazed but she is certainly love crazed and we'll get to that shortly but when we join the pair the next day they're off to visit the monkeys at a Conservation Park and while Rene is meant to be guiding chitty she hasn't quite got used to her new role yet sound of the B and the water floting man he's [Music] awesome oh poor chitty was brought back to Earth with a bump there he was trying to give Renee an understanding of what life is like for him what he can hear only for his guide to not just not notice the tree branch but not even realize that he' bumped into it either now thankfully it doesn't ruin the moment and when a monkey crosses their path Renee in a little too confident a manner begins to stroke him but but this isn't one of your chickens Renee this is a wild monkey he's right here hey byby oh he has tiny tiny little eyes and a cute little mouth he's a little fatty okay I almost had a stroke jeez Rene's lucky that that monkey didn't scratch her eyes out okay I almost stroke that would have been a wild twist wouldn't it if they both ended up blind now on that topic of blindness Renee turns the conversation over to how chitty actually became blind and I'm slightly surprised she doesn't already know this after years of talking but chitty recounts what he'd previously told us before he tells her how he first became blind in one eye because an apple fell from a tree and hit him in the eye and then as a result of the loss of vision in that eye he sometime later fell over and hit hit the other eye on the corner of a bench now interestingly he does also add that the loss of vision in the first eye is caused by glaucoma but he believes it can be traced back to the Apple hitting his face now whatever the true medical diagnosis ultimately now he is almost completely blind in both eyes I was taking to the hospital and they just couldn't help I couldn't see what it they came sorry Renee is upset as she hears this story and she says to chitty if I could pay for surgery to help you regain your vision i' do it in a heartbeat it's a sweet thing for her to say particularly given that she's told us in the past one of the things that attracted her to chitty is the fact that he's blind but her sentiment does put a smile on chitty's face only not for long because what she says next wipes that smile clean off do you believe that you became blind spiritually what like the whole thing is spiritually connected because if you could see I wouldn't be here what's Renee suggesting here like is she really trying to say that the Universe God whatever it may be made chitty blind so that the two of them can be together that's a wild thing to say isn't it Rene's admitted to us that she was excited to find out chitty was blind because now she doesn't have to feel insecure so her linking chitty's blindness to somehow being fate fate that she found a man she didn't have to feel insecure with is frankly a really inconsiderate thing for her to say the world doesn't revolve around you Renee when I met jitty after he told me he was blind I felt kind of relieved like oh my God I don't have to be so self-conscious anymore it allowed me to feel closer to him than anybody I had ever been with what the Renee even if that is true there are certain things that you keep to yourself because saying them out loud makes you look sick she really is a little bit crazy this woman isn't she she truly honestly thinks that her and chitty's souls Were Meant to find each other and that his blindness was a vessel to bring them together I think something spiritual happened to him that made him lose his sight so that we could come together it's just adding up to like the perfect thing do you believe that I was brought here by God himself as a miracle it's as if there's no filter with this woman she speaks without thinking the notion the idea that the Universe disabled chitty for Life took away his sight so that she can feel better about the way she looks it's such a horrific thing for her to think much less for her to vocalize that chitty can't actually believe what he's hearing it's made chitty feel really uncom comfortable all of a sudden she says bizarre and weird things like my blindness is for a purpose which is outlandish and kind of insulting it seems like he lives in alternate reality yeah chitty thinks that Renee lives in an alternate reality and when she says stupid sh like this it makes him very very concerned for their future together he admits and truth be told I think he's right to be worried with everything that this lady believes and more importantly with everything she believes he is misguided about I'm struggling to see what these two actually have in common
