[Brett Kettler] - "Hey Kimber, did you catch the latest from Microsoft Ignite? They're really pushing AI everywhere."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Oh, absolutely! I saw something about Copilot Actions. What are they all about?"

[Brett Kettler] - "Well, it's like making your AI do the grunt work. Imagine you tell it to schedule meetings or manage your inbox, and it just does it."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Sounds handy. But what's this about AI agents for SharePoint?"

[Brett Kettler] - "Yeah, they're introducing AI agents that can work within SharePoint. Think of it like having a little robot coworker that knows your workflow."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Ha hahaha, like having a digital assistant that doesn't need coffee breaks."

[Brett Kettler] - "Exactly! And they're not stopping there. They've got these new tools for project management and employee self-service."

[Kimber Kettler] - "I'm all for tools that help with project management, but how ethical is it to automate everything?"

[Brett Kettler] - "Hmm, well, it's about efficiency, right? But, yeah, there's this whole ethical debate around anthropomorphizing AI."

[Kimber Kettler] - "What do you mean by that?"

[Brett Kettler] - "It's when we start attributing human traits to AI. Like thinking of it as a person rather than a tool. It can lead to trust issues."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Oh, like when people get too attached to their AI assistants?"

[Brett Kettler] - "Yeah, or when they expect AI to reason like humans. But AI isn't reasoning; it's pattern matching."

[Kimber Kettler] - "So, it's not really thinking, just predicting patterns from its data?"

[Brett Kettler] - "Exactly. And that's why we need to be careful about how we use AI, especially in critical situations where real human reasoning is needed."

[Kimber Kettler] - "That makes sense. But what about all these new AI tools? Are they just making the same old AI smarter?"

[Brett Kettler] - "There's a shift towards hybrid AI now. It's not just about making one model better but combining different AI and non-AI models to tackle those persistent issues like factual accuracy."

[Kimber Kettler] - "So, it's like a team of AI working together?"

[Brett Kettler] - "Spot on! And it's not just about making AI smarter; it's about making it more applicable. Like, you know, those tools for visualizing flood scenarios?"

[Kimber Kettler] - "Yeah, I read about that! It's pretty cool how AI can help in disaster planning."

[Brett Kettler] - "It's more than cool; it's transformative. But there's also this growing concern about the ROI on some AI applications. Are we really getting our money's worth?"

[Kimber Kettler] - "Good point. I mean, if the tech is just plateauing, why keep investing?"

[Brett Kettler] - "That's where hybrid AI comes in. It's about improving functionality, not just chasing after the next big model. And speaking of which, did you see Nvidia's server redesign?"

[Kimber Kettler] - "No, what happened?"

[Brett Kettler] - "Their new GPUs were overheating, so they had to redesign the server racks. It's a reminder that hardware is as crucial as software in AI."

[Kimber Kettler] - "That's wild. But hey, isn't there something about AI and accessibility?"

[Brett Kettler] - "Oh, yeah! There's this app, Be My AI, helping people with visual impairments. It's AI describing the world for them."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Wow, that's beautiful. It's like AI is not just for the tech-savvy but for everyone."

[Brett Kettler] - "And that's the future we're looking at, where AI isn't just a tool but a part of our daily lives, enhancing our capabilities and making life easier."

[Kimber Kettler] - "I'm excited to see where all this goes. But for now, let's keep our expectations grounded and use AI wisely."

[Brett Kettler] - "Absolutely, Kimber. Wise use of AI is the key. Well, that's it for today's Visionary Bytes. Thanks for joining us, folks!"

[Kimber Kettler] - "Thanks for tuning in, everyone. Until next time, keep questioning, keep exploring, and stay visionary!"
