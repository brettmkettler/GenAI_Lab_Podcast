**Title: Real-Time Chess: The Future of Gaming or a Niche Nightmare?**

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Hey, everyone, welcome back to AI Futures Lab Visionary Bytes. Today, we're diving into something pretty wild - real-time chess. Not the chess you're thinking of, Kimber."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "Oh, really? Chess has always seemed like the epitome of turn-based strategy. What's different here?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Well, imagine chess, but without turns. Each piece has a cooldown, but otherwise, you can move whenever you want. It's like chess meets a real-time strategy game."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "That sounds chaotic! How does that even work?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "It's all about the cool down. When you move a piece, it's locked down for a few seconds. But, the twist is, there's no checkmate; you lose when your king is captured."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "Huh, that does change the game entirely. So, you made this board, right?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Yes, I did. And let me tell you, it was quite the project. I had to deal with electromagnets, LEDs, and all sorts of tech to make it work."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "Sounds like you went full tech nerd on this one. Electromagnets? Really?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Ha hahaha, yeah, to keep the pieces in place during their cool down. No cheating allowed!"

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "I can imagine Isaac trying to cheat though, huh?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Oh, absolutely. That's why the board physically locks the pieces. You can't move them even if you try."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "That's... actually really cool. But how do you detect when a piece should be moved?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Good question. Each player wears a wristband that applies a different frequency of voltage. The board can tell who's touching what piece."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "So, you're saying you're zapping players?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Haha, not exactly. It's a very low voltage, just enough for detection. Completely safe, I promise."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "That's reassuring. Did you play any games on this board yet?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "We did, and it was a blast. Imagine the chaos of pieces moving all over the place. It's like watching a real-time strategy game unfold right on the board."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "Sounds intense. Did you notice any unique strategies emerging?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Definitely. One thing we saw a lot was the 'inadvisable king blunder'. Since there's no checkmate, players sometimes forget to protect their king in the heat of the moment."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "That's hilarious. And sad for the player, I guess. But what about the learning curve? How hard is it to get into?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "It's steep, but that's part of the fun. You've got to keep track of everything at once. It's like playing four games at the same time."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "Sounds like a workout for the brain. Is this the future of chess?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Maybe not for everyone, but it's definitely a niche that some will love. It's chess on steroids, or should I say, chess on AI."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "AI? How does AI fit into this?"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Well, imagine if AI could play this version of chess. The strategies could be mind-blowing. It's a new frontier for AI in gaming."

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "That would be something to see. AI outsmarting humans in real-time chaos."

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Exactly. And maybe, just maybe, we'll see AI-driven chess tournaments in real-time. But for now, let's keep enjoying the madness with our human friends. Thanks for tuning in, folks!"

**[Kimber Kettler]** - "Thanks, everyone! And remember, chess might be boring, but real-time chess? That's a whole different story. See you next time!"

**[Brett Kettler]** - "Stay curious, stay creative, and keep pushing the boundaries. Bye for now!"
