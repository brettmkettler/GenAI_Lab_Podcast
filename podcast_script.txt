[Kimber Kettler] - "Oh, yeah? What's new?"

[Brett Kettler] - "We've got this chatbot now. You don't even have to read the report anymore."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Haha, that sounds like cheating!"

[Brett Kettler] - "Nah, it's more about testing new tech. We're pushing boundaries, you know?"

[Kimber Kettler] - "So, what's the big trend you're excited about?"

[Brett Kettler] - "When Code Goes No. That's my favorite."

[Kimber Kettler] - "When what now?"

[Brett Kettler] - "When Code Goes No. It's about moving from no-code to low-code, to actually not needing to code at all. You interact with tech in natural language."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Huh, that sounds like magic."

[Brett Kettler] - "It's not magic, it's AI, babe. It's about speed and agility for developers. They can build stuff faster without the crazy coding structures."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Only 10?"

[Brett Kettler] - "Yeah, we keep it light so you don't feel overwhelmed. And we're introducing two new principles to make sure you've got a framework to work with."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Sounds like a lot of work!"

[Brett Kettler] - "It's about aligning your enterprise, your organization, your stakeholders to a new vision. That's what gets me excited."

[Kimber Kettler] - "I see, so it's not just about the tech, but how you use it to bring value to customers?"

[Brett Kettler] - "Exactly. That's the whole point. Tech should serve, not just exist."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Makes sense. So, when can I chat with this Technovision chatbot?"

[Brett Kettler] - "It's live now, go ahead and give it a spin. Ask it anything about the trends or technologies."

[Kimber Kettler] - "Alright, I'm on it. Let's see how smart this bot is."
